## Movie List

1.	Set up a new React application using create-react-app.
2.	Create a MovieList component that will be the main component of your application.
3.	Inside the MovieList component, create an array of movie objects. Each movie object should have the following properties:
    - Title
    - Genre
    - ReleaseYear
4.	Render the list of movies in the following format:
    - Display the movie title, genre, and release year.
    - Each movie should be displayed as a separate list item or card.
5.	Implement a filter functionality:
    - Create a dropdown select element that contains all the unique genres from the movies list.
    - When the user selects a genre from the dropdown, filter the movies based on the selected genre and display only the movies that match the selected genre.
    - If the user selects "All Genres" from the dropdown, display all the movies.
6.	Implement the functionality to handle user events:
    - When the user clicks on a movie, displays an alert with the movie title.
7.	Use JSX syntax to write the component markup and JSX expressions for dynamic data rendering.
8.	Use stateful components to manage the movie list and the selected genre.
9.	Use functional components and hooks where appropriate.
10.	Use import and export statements to organize your code and components.
11.	Apply styles to your components using CSS or any styling approach of your choice.
